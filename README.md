## JavaScript

Javascript files should go to folder 'js' and end with '.js'. All new javascript files have to be included in index.html. 

Recommended IDE: Webstorm (free educational version available using TU Wien e-mail address)

*Important*: do not run index.html from the file system! Only execute it from inside WebStorm 
(by selecting a browser icon from the top right panel that appears when you open index.html) 
or from hosting the project within another web server. Opening index.html directly in the browser without a server
will result in an error when trying to load the the .essl shader files. 


## Shaders

.essl is the OpenGL ES shading language. Shader files should all be located in the folder 'shaders' and end with '.essl'.  

Recommended code editor: Visual Studio Code (free): https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install syntax highlighting for shading languages: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader

Enable syntax highlighting: open shader file --> in the blue bar on the bottom, switch from plain text to GLSL
